# GLOBE Data Guidance and Submission Standards for Curated Data Sets
The primary goal of the data submission process is to make curated datasets from the GLOBE community Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR). The table below summarizes activities performed during and after the publication process.

## File Structure
- Check file integrity (e.g., checksum, file size, corruption)
- File organization is consistent and appropriate
- Files are in a stable, well-documented format and can be opened with multiple applications
- Filenames are unique, descriptive, and consistent
- File header information is complete and consistent with documentation
- File properties (e.g., dimensions, grid size) are appropriate for the format
## Documentation
- Data descriptions match the submission
- Data are clearly described
- Dimensions, variables, and attributes are well defined and follow ISO standards
- Application of the data is described
- Methods, are detailed,  repeatable and accompanied with complete and executable code 
- Quality assessment and controls are described
- Known issues and data limitations are clearly described
- Statements have in-text citations that match the list of references
- Summary of the data and process of developing curated data set is provided
## Data Values
- Value ranges and extremes are valid
- Units are appropriate and defined
- Data can be visualized using a plot or map
- Coded field, data flags, and missing values are defined
- Accuracy and precision is reasonable
## Spatial Information
- Spatial coverage and resolution are persistent and as described
- Coordinate system is well-defined, including spatial extent, spatial resolution, boundary, and scale
- Map projections are appropriate and well-defined
- Values of longitude variable go from west (-180) to east (180) and latitude variable go from south (-90) to north (90)
## Temporal Information
Temporal coverage and resolution are persistent and as described
Uses the ISO standard date and time formats
Attributes related to date and time are complete and include a calendar, units, and bounds
